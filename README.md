# Social Network Project VC | React Version

As usual, all the work will be done in [development](https://github.com/VividCiphers/Social-Network-Project-React-Version/tree/development) branch.

And, all the reference files like screenshots and research will be stored in [reference](https://github.com/VividCiphers/Social-Network-Project-React-Version/tree/reference) branch. 

To start working on components, clone this repository using good old `git clone https://github.com/VividCiphers/Social-Network-Project-React-Version.git`command.

Now, move into the repository in terminal and type:
`git checkout development`

__NOTE__ Before you can run this project, you need to run `npm install` from the commandline to install all dependencies.

Now, do not alter or change anything in this branch,
Make another branch. Name it anything you want, say **my-features**
`git branch my-features`

Move to your branch by:
`git checkout my-features`

**my-features** is the branch where you will work as you like.
Once you are happy with the changes, just commit and submit your code to github by:
`git push -u origin my-features`

Next, create a Pull request and you are good to go!
